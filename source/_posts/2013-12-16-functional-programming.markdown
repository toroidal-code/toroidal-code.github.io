A lot of programmers start with C, or C++, or Java. They're currently the big three in the industry, with good reason: they're time-tried, and cross-platform.  

Other areas have their own (preferred) languages:

- Web:
	- Ruby (Rails, Sinatra, Padrino)
	- Python (Django, Flask)
	- Java/Scala (Play)
- Academia (PLT): 
	- Haskell
	- Standard ML
	- OCaml
	- Scheme
- Systems Programming:
	- C/C++ (especially embedded)
	- Go
	- Rust
	- D

Of course, these languages can also be used for general-use programming. I regularly use Ruby for quick prototyping, and then move to another language more suited to what I actually need.

Functional programming is based on Alonzo Church's [Î»-calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus).
